* Org-Browser
** Description
   An attempt to create an org-mode-ish clone in the browser to make it accessible
   to the average person, especially since the average person can actually relate 
   to this unique note taking program,  unlike emacs as a whole which is connected
   mostly to programmers.

***** TODO Input
      Input is a langauge. Syllables combine into words, words into sentences, 
      sentences paragraphs... the point is, this combine as such.  Our syllables
      are just the letters, our sentences should be lispy too.  Hmmm .. how to 
      determine beginning and endings of words?
      >cd
      command []
      >m
      command move
      >backspace
      command 
      >q 
      
      >c 
      command 
      >l
      [last : ls , lab : lb , lost : lo] (With the letters you need to press next 
      highlighted, and the letters you don't need to press because it can be assumed
      will be red]

      >a
      command (last 
      >c
      [command : cd, commands : cs]
